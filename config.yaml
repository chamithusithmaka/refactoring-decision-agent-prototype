# RDP Agent Configuration
# =======================
# Adjust weights, severity ordering, and thresholds without code changes.

# Scoring weights for candidate selection.
# Formula: score = complexity_weight * (4 - complexity) + risk_weight * (4 - risk) + impact_weight * impact
weights:
  complexity_weight: 0.2
  risk_weight: 0.4
  impact_weight: 0.4

# Severity priority (higher number = higher priority during sequencing).
severity_order:
  critical: 4
  high: 3
  medium: 2
  low: 1

# Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
log_level: INFO
